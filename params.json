Not all members are included yet, the project just started. It is driven by the community and growing.\r\n\r\n## Ad yourself to the map\r\n\r\nFeel free to ad your personal data to the json file if you are a member of the group and would like to see which startups are developing around your location. I will update the map hosted at mapz.com frequently.\r\n\r\n## Help to make the code better\r\n\r\nThere is a lot of room for improvement regarding responsiveness and cool features. Just go for it. The map is based on the API of the mapping service https://www.mapz.com which is basically a custom build of OpenLayers 3. You can use the code on localhost without an API key. If you need a API Key to install the map on a public server, just send a short request to api.key@mapz.com and tell us the domain.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
