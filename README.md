# slack_startup map

Just point your browser to https://www.mapz.com/static/startup/slack_startup.html to see the members of the community or search for particular skills of the members. Not all members are included yet, the project just started. It is driven by the community and growing.

# Add yourself to the map

Feel free to add your personal data to the json file if you are a member of the group and would like to see which startups are developing around your location. I will update the map hosted at mapz.com frequently.

# Help to make the code better

There is a lot of room for improvement regarding responsiveness and cool features. Just go for it. The map is based on the API of the mapping service https://www.mapz.com/api which is basically a custom build of OpenLayers 3. You can use the code on localhost without an API key. If you need a API Key to install the map on a public server, just send a short request to api.key@mapz.com and tell us the domain.
